Hey, I'm Graeme and welcome to my portfolio site.

I'm 40 years old, originally from central Scotland and now based in the lovely town of Morpeth, in Northumberland. I moved to the North East in late 2001 and have never looked back!

I have two wonderful children aged 12 and 9 and an equally wonderful partner, who's age is to remain private :D

I wanted to use this page, not to re-hash my c.v. but explain a little about my passion for data and to answer a couple of key questions that I 'think' a recruiter may have..

**Why transition into data?**

Data has been a constant across all of my roles. During my time in e-commerce I was burried in Google Analytics data, daily. When I moved into multi-channel I designed a loyalty scheme and implemented a CRM system. During Covid I build the companies PowerBi architecture and more laterally I worked across IT, Data and Dev on various projects, one example being an ML application to predict sales and suggest stock movements. I loved all of those types of work and would like to spend more time doing that.

**Why did I quit a director level role to focus on a data role?**

A. So there's a few reasons, let me break them down 1) in senior tech roles it can be a bit manic and there is always sense that you're chasing your tail and spinning an increasing number of plates - I would like to put a few plates down and spin them much better. 2) I delivered large transformation projects for several years and they are relentless. I'm absolutely not afraid of hard work, its in my DNA, but burn out is real and it happened to me. After delivering my last project, I knew I'd left the business in a good state and I was ready for a new challenge in an area I love - data.

**Will I have any difficulties dropped in seniority?**

A. Absolutely not - infact it's something I'm actually looking forwrd too!
